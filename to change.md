## Quick fixes:
* Variable importance as pie chart, not text (%)
* Add benchmark (e.g. data set loan approval rate)

* Check project report, add plot changes, correlation heat map

## More time consuming/requires further education:
* Get away from mode imputation and try K-nearest neighbor
* Model improvement via cross-validation and hyper parameter optimization
* Model improvement via gradient boosted trees and xgboost
