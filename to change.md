## Quick fixes:
* Check project report, add plot changes, correlation heat map

## More time consuming/requires further education:
* Get away from mode imputation and try K-nearest neighbor
* Model improvement via cross-validation and hyper parameter optimization
* Model improvement via gradient boosted trees and xgboost
